# GDPR-Samples
## Sample implementations for GDPR for various technology stacks

### Objectives
The European Union (EU) [General Data Protection Regulations](https://gdpr-info.eu) (GDPR) apply to almost everyone developing or operating a website used by people in the EU. If you
are selling good or services from such a website then these regulations apply even if you're not located in the EU. The fines for flouting the regulations can be 
substantial; 10 Million EUR, or 2% of total worldwide turnover.

This project aims to help micro and small development shops building websites comply with GDPR and similar regulations by providing information as well as reference implementations on a variety of technology stacks. It might also prove a useful resource for larger organisations by helping to clarify the essential requirements for GDPR and encouraging the dissemination of knowledge. 

### Getting Started
**The best place to start is the project's [wiki](https://github.com/wpqs/GDPR-Samples/wiki)** where you'll find documentation about GDPR requirements and how they might be implemented 
togther with links to specific implementations on various technology stacks.

### Contributors
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project. However, I am particularly interested in attracting people from throughout the EU who work for any of the supervisory 
authorities (regulators), lawyers with expertise in GDPR, trade bodies developing codes of conduct, certification bodies for such codes of conduct, as well as developers 
biulding websites using technology stacks that are not currently supported.
